    <h2>JavaScript</h2>
    <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/script" target="_blank" title="JavaScript">JavaScript(English:
            JavaScript)</a>is an object-based script programming language. This language is commonly used
        within a Web browser and has the ability to access built-in objects from other applications. It is also used for
        server programming, such as runtime environments such as Node.js. JavaScript was originally developed by
        BrendanEich of Netscape Communications Corporation,first named Mocha and later liveScript, and eventually became
        JavaScript.<img src="JacaScript.jpg" width="100%"> There are similaritiesbetween Javaand syntax in Sun
        Microsystems,but this is actually because both
        languages are based on the basic syntax of the C language,and Java and JavaScript have a weak direct connection.
        Other than names and phrases,there are more similarities to self orscheme than Java. JavaScript is recognized as
        the language that best implements ecmascriptstandards and is supported by default in most browsers until
        ECMAScript 5 (ES5), but after ECMAScript 6 it is compiled into a transfilerfor browser compatibility.</p>
